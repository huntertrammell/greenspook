## Story

### _Scene 1_

> Cold winter night - bright stars like teeth
> Shed light on churchyard underneath.
> Graves like eyes, covered with snow,
> Shine under the moonâ€™s gray glow.

Commentary of how we interpreted this stanza

### _Scene 2_

> The churchâ€™s path is empty, clear;
> That does not mean no soul is near.
> The graves within hide secrets deep:
> Not all spirits in them sleep.

### _Scene 3_

> Way down below, in forlorn Hell,
> Lost spirits, suffering, do dwell.
> Hellâ€™s river runs deep and wide,
> Drowning spirits in its tide.

### _Scene 4_

> Such spirits wade through waters black,
> Struggling for salvation back.
> They do not find what they so seek -
> Only boiling rivers bleak.

### _Scene 5_

> What lies beyond the riverâ€™s shores?
> From where do these souls come in scores?
> The river keeps its history,
> Its misery, its mystery;

### _Scene 6_

> Meanwhile, its poor spirits groan,
> Doomed to wander Hell alone.
> They are trapped, ever condemned
> To wander waters with no end.

### _Scene 7_

> Up above, the churchyard sleeps
> As moonlight over shadows creeps.
> Some graves within rest full, rest well;
> Othersâ€™ souls, still stuck in Hell.

### _Scene 8_

> When morning sheds its cleansing light,
> Banishing the gloom of night,
> Down below, souls will still roam,
> Searching for salvation - home.
